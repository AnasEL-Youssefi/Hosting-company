🧩 CloudPanel + FOSSBilling Integration

CloudPanel-FOSSBilling is a fully automated deployment and integration solution that connects CloudPanel
 (a modern hosting control panel) with FOSSBilling
 (an open-source billing system).
The project provisions both services on an Azure Virtual Machine, automates installation through Ansible and shell scripts, and enables webhook-based communication between the two platforms.
